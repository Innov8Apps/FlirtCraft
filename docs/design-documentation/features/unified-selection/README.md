## Feature Overview

**Tab Location**: Chat Tab (Custom Conversations)

The Unified Selection feature is specifically for the **Chat tab**, allowing users to create custom conversation scenarios. It combines location and difficulty selection on a single elegant screen, with options for small tweaks/customizations before proceeding. After selection, AI generates randomized context based on these choices. This is a **P0 MVP feature** that streamlines the custom conversation creation process.

**Note**: This feature is distinct from the Scenarios tab's pre-built scenario selection system, which uses predefined templates for context generation.

## Key User Needs Addressed

### Primary Goals
- **Streamlined Selection**: Users can see all options at once without multiple screens
- **Visual Browsing**: Horizontal scroll allows for engaging location discovery
- **Immediate Context**: Both location and difficulty visible together for informed decisions
- **Faster Flow**: Reduces steps from 3 to 2 in Chat tab flow

### User Value Proposition
"Create custom conversation practice sessions with an elegant, unified selection experience that combines beautiful location browsing with clear difficulty options."

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Metrics
- **Selection Time**: Target <45 seconds from entry to "Create Scenario" button
- **Exploration Rate**: >60% of users browse multiple locations before selecting
- **Completion Rate**: >85% of users who reach this screen complete both selections
- **Return Rate**: 75%+ users return to create additional custom conversations

### Usability Effectiveness
- **Location Discovery**: Users discover and select locations they hadn't considered before
- **Difficulty Calibration**: Appropriate difficulty selection improves (more users select Yellow/Red when ready)
- **Flow Satisfaction**: Users rate unified selection as more enjoyable than separate screens
- **Error Reduction**: Fewer instances of users changing difficulty after context creation

## Design System Integration

### Location Selection (Top 60% of screen)
- **Horizontal Infinity Scroll**: Smooth momentum scrolling with snap-to-center physics
- **Card Specifications**: 280px Ã— 180px with 16px spacing
- **Visual Treatment**: High-quality location images with subtle gradient overlays
- **Selection State**: 3px Primary color border with enhanced shadow
- **Peek Behavior**: Shows ~20% of adjacent cards for navigation affordance

#### 8 Location Options:
1. **Coffee Shop** - Warm, inviting interior with natural lighting
2. **Bar/Lounge** - Upscale social atmosphere with ambient lighting
3. **Bookstore** - Cozy reading environment with literary atmosphere
4. **Gym** - Modern fitness facility with active energy
5. **Park** - Beautiful outdoor setting with natural elements
6. **Campus** - University environment with academic context
7. **Grocery Store** - Modern retail setting with everyday interactions
8. **Art Gallery** - Contemporary cultural space with artistic atmosphere

### Difficulty Selection (Bottom 40% of screen)
- **Three-Card Layout**: Equal width distribution with 12px spacing
- **Card Height**: 120px for adequate content and touch targets
- **Color Coding**: Gradient backgrounds matching difficulty themes
- **Selection State**: 2px border in darker shade of primary color with scale animation

#### Difficulty Options:
- **ðŸŸ¢ Green (Friendly)**: "Open and encouraging" - Linear gradient from #10B981 to #047857
- **ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (Real Talk)**: "Realistic interactions" - Linear gradient from #F59E0B to #D97706  
- **ðŸ”´ Red (A-Game)**: "Challenge yourself" - Linear gradient from #EF4444 to #DC2626

### Action Section
- **Create Scenario Button**: Full-width primary button
- **Enabled State**: Only when both location and difficulty are selected
- **Disabled State**: Subtle styling with explanatory text
- **Loading State**: Button shows loading indicator during context generation

## Interaction Design

### Location Carousel Behavior
- **Initial State**: First card (Coffee Shop) centered
- **Scroll Physics**: Natural momentum with spring deceleration (tension: 300, friction: 30)
- **Snap Behavior**: Automatic centering to nearest card after scroll ends
- **Selection Feedback**: Immediate border animation and shadow enhancement
- **Touch Targets**: Full card area (280px Ã— 180px) is touchable

### Difficulty Selection Behavior  
- **Default State**: All cards visible with color-coded backgrounds
- **Selection Animation**: Scale to 1.05x with border and shadow enhancement
- **Deselection**: Previously selected card smoothly returns to default state
- **Touch Feedback**: 0.98x scale decrease during press for immediate feedback

### Combined Selection Logic
- **Validation**: Both selections required before "Create Scenario" button enables
- **State Management**: Maintains selections during screen lifecycle
- **Error Prevention**: Clear visual feedback for incomplete selection
- **Quick Selection**: Users can select location and difficulty in any order

## Accessibility Features

### Screen Reader Support
- **Location Carousel**: Proper announcement of current location and scroll position
- **Difficulty Cards**: Clear description of each difficulty level and requirements
- **Selection States**: Immediate announcement when selections are made
- **Button States**: Clear indication of enabled/disabled state and requirements

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab Order**: Location carousel â†’ difficulty cards â†’ action button
- **Arrow Keys**: Left/right navigation through location carousel
- **Space/Enter**: Selection activation for focused cards
- **Escape**: Return to previous screen

### Motor Accessibility
- **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements exceed 44Ã—44px minimum
- **Spacing**: Adequate space between adjacent interactive elements
- **Selection Forgiveness**: Large touch targets reduce selection errors
- **Alternative Interactions**: All gestures have button-based alternatives

## Performance Considerations

### Image Loading Strategy
- **Progressive Loading**: Low-quality placeholders while high-res images load
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load as they approach viewport in carousel
- **Caching**: Location images cached after first load for instant subsequent access
- **Fallback**: Text-only display if images fail to load

### Animation Performance
- **Hardware Acceleration**: All animations use transform and opacity properties
- **60fps Target**: Optimized animations for smooth carousel scrolling
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user's motion sensitivity preferences
- **Memory Management**: Efficient cleanup of animation resources

## Platform-Specific Adaptations

### iOS Specific
- **Momentum Physics**: Native iOS scroll momentum behavior
- **Haptic Feedback**: Subtle haptics on location selection and difficulty change
- **Safe Areas**: Proper handling of notch and home indicator spacing

### Android Specific  
- **Material Physics**: Android-appropriate scroll physics and deceleration
- **Ripple Effects**: Material Design touch feedback on card selection
- **System Animations**: Respects Android system animation scale settings

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Network Issues
- **Offline Mode**: Cached location images allow browsing without connection
- **Poor Connection**: Graceful degradation with loading indicators
- **Failed Loads**: Clear error messaging with retry options

### Selection Issues
- **Rapid Tapping**: Debounced selection to prevent double-selection issues
- **Gesture Conflicts**: Proper separation of scroll vs tap gestures
- **State Recovery**: Maintains selections through app backgrounding

### Content Issues
- **Missing Images**: Fallback to color-coded cards with location names
- **Content Loading**: Skeleton screens during initial content load
- **Dynamic Content**: Ability to add new locations without app updates
