## Feature Overview

The FlirtCraft gamification system transforms conversation practice from simple repetition into an engaging, motivating experience. By rewarding progress, celebrating achievements, and visualizing improvement over time, the system maintains long-term user engagement while supporting the core mission of building romantic conversation confidence.

## Design Philosophy

### Intrinsic Motivation Support
**Purpose-Driven Rewards:**
- XP and achievements directly reflect real skill development
- Progress visualization shows actual improvement in conversation confidence
- Rewards celebrate meaningful milestones rather than arbitrary metrics
- System supports user goals rather than creating artificial competition

**Psychological Foundations:**
- **Competence**: Clear skill progression through levels and achievements
- **Autonomy**: User controls their practice schedule and focus areas
- **Progress**: Visible improvement tracking builds momentum and confidence
- **Mastery**: Advanced achievements recognize sophisticated social skills

### Non-Exploitative Design
**Healthy Engagement:**
- No artificial time pressure or FOMO mechanisms
- Achievements celebrate actual skill development
- Progress tracking supports learning goals
- Optional participation - all core features remain accessible without gamification

## User Stories

- Feedback patterns inform personalized achievement recommendations

**6 Advanced Metrics Integration:**
The gamification system directly integrates with the feedback system's 6 sophisticated evaluation metrics:
- **AI Engagement Quality** (0-100): Drives context usage XP bonuses and "Context Master" achievement
- **Responsiveness & Active Listening** (0-100): Unlocks listening skill XP and "Empathy Expert" achievement
- **Storytelling & Narrative Building** (0-100): Feeds storytelling skill progression

  longestStreak: number;
  lastPracticeDate: Date;
  
  // Conversation Analytics
  totalConversations: number;
  scenarioCompletionCounts: Map<string, number>;
  difficultyDistribution: Map<string, number>;
  
  // Progress Tracking
  weeklyXP: number[];
  monthlyStats: MonthlyStats;
  skillProgressTracking: SkillProgress;
}
```

**Achievement Schema:**
```typescript
interface Achievement {
  id: string;
