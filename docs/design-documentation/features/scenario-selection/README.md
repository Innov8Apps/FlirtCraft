## Feature Overview

**Tab Location**: Scenarios Tab (Pre-built Scenarios with Templates)

The Scenario Selection feature is specifically for the **Scenarios tab**, offering users pre-built, trendy scenarios with templated contexts. Unlike the Chat tab's custom conversation creation, these scenarios come with predefined templates and trending topics. This is a **P0 MVP feature** that provides quick-start practice options.

**Note**: This feature is distinct from the Chat tab's unified selection for custom conversations.
