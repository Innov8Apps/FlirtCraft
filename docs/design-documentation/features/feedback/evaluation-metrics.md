## Detailed Scoring Rubrics

### 1. AI Engagement Quality Score

#### Exceptional Performance (90-100)
**What This Looks Like**:
- Seamlessly incorporates multiple appearance cues into natural conversation flow
- "I love that vintage band t-shirt - are you into classic rock? That leather jacket gives you such a cool, approachable vibe."
- Transforms environmental details into conversation opportunities
- "This coffee shop playlist is perfect for deep conversations - much better than the usual generic stuff."
- Creates original variations of AI suggestions that feel authentic
- Takes "Comment on their book" suggestion and says: "I see you're reading Murakami - his surreal style either captivates people completely or confuses them. Which camp are you in?"

**User Feedback Example**:
"Outstanding context integration! You made the pre-conversation details feel like natural observations rather than forced comments. Your approach to the reading suggestion was creative and engaging."

**Next Level Guidance**:
"You've mastered context integration. Try experimenting with weaving multiple context elements into single responses for even more sophisticated conversations."

#### Good Performance (70-79)
**What This Looks Like**:
- Uses 2-3 context elements appropriately throughout conversation
- Makes relevant comments about AI's appearance or environment
- Follows AI suggestions with minor personal adaptations
- Shows awareness of conversational context

**User Feedback Example**:
"Good use of context! You incorporated the details naturally. Try making your observations more specific and personal to create deeper connection."

**Improvement Guidance**:
"Focus on creating unique variations of suggested approaches. Instead of using conversation starters exactly as suggested, add your personal style to make them feel more authentic."

#### Needs Practice (50-69)
**What This Looks Like**:
- Uses some context elements but feels forced or unnatural
- Basic acknowledgment of appearance or environment
- Relies heavily on exact AI suggestions without personalization

**User Feedback Example**:
"You're starting to use context well! Work on making your references feel more conversational. Practice weaving details into your responses more smoothly."

**Improvement Guidance**:
"Try the 'observation + question' formula: Notice something specific, then ask an engaging question about it. This makes context integration feel more natural."
