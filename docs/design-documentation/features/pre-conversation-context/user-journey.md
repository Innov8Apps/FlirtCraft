## Journey Overview

The pre-conversation context user journey transforms selections from either tab into comprehensive preparation:

**Chat Tab**: After unified selection and small customizations, AI generates randomized context based on location and difficulty choices.

**Scenarios Tab**: After selecting a pre-built scenario, AI generates context following templates with variation to ensure freshness.

Both paths lead to comprehensive preparation that builds confidence, sets expectations, and provides necessary context for successful practice.

## User Journey Mapping

### Entry Points and Context

#### Primary Entry Points

**From Chat Tab - Unified Selection:**
- Has selected location and difficulty on unified screen
- May have made small customizations
- Expects AI to generate randomized, fresh context
- Wants creative scenarios based on their selections

**From Scenarios Tab - Pre-built Selection:**
- Has chosen a trending/curated scenario
- Selected difficulty level
- Expects templated but varied context
- Wants quick start with professional guidance

**Mental Model:**
- "I want to know what I'm walking into"
- "I need context to feel prepared and confident"
- "I want to practice this realistically but safely"
- "I hope the AI gives me enough detail to feel ready"

**Success Criteria for This Journey:**
- User feels confident and prepared to start conversation
- User understands the scenario context thoroughly
- User has conversation starter options ready
- User transitions smoothly to conversation without abandonment

### Detailed Journey Steps

#### Step 1: Context Generation Loading (2-3 seconds)

**User Experience:**
- **Visual State**: Loading screen with "Creating your scenario..." message
- **Progress Indicator**: Subtle animation showing AI is working
- **Emotional State**: Anticipation building, slight nervousness about what scenario will be generated
- **Expectations**: Hoping for interesting but not overwhelming scenario details

**User Thoughts During Loading:**
- "I wonder what kind of person they'll create for me to talk to"
- "I hope this scenario feels realistic"
- "What if I don't like the context they generate?"
- "This is exciting but I'm a bit nervous"

**Critical UX Requirements:**
- Loading never exceeds 3 seconds (technical requirement)
- Loading message provides clear expectation of what's happening
- Animation keeps user engaged without causing anxiety
- No progress bars that might create pressure or timeline stress

**Potential Exit Points:**
- **Back Navigation**: User changes mind and wants to select different scenario
- **App Interruption**: Phone call, notification, or app backgrounding
- **Technical Issues**: Loading fails or takes too long

**Error Handling:**
- Loading failure shows friendly message with retry option
- Network timeout gracefully falls back to pre-written context for popular scenarios
- App interruption saves progress and allows seamless return

#### Step 2: Context Cards Presentation (First Impression)

**Initial Visual Impact:**
- Four distinct context cards appear with smooth stagger animation
- Each card has clear iconography and color coding for easy identification
- Overall layout feels organized and comprehensive without overwhelming
- Orange accent color (`#F97316`) draws attention to primary action areas

**User's First 5 Seconds:**
1. **Visual Scan**: Eyes move across the four cards to get overall sense
2. **Relevance Check**: Quick assessment of whether context feels realistic
3. **Completeness Assessment**: Do I have enough information to feel prepared?
