## Feature Overview

The Pre-Conversation Context feature provides AI-generated scenario information before starting practice conversations, with different generation approaches for each tab:

**Chat Tab Flow**: After unified selection (location + difficulty), AI generates randomized context based on these choices. Users can make small tweaks/selections to customize certain aspects before starting.

**Scenarios Tab Flow**: After selecting a pre-built scenario, AI generates context following predefined templates and parameters. While the core scenario is defined, AI ensures variation so each generation feels fresh and unique.

Both approaches provide comprehensive context about the practice partner, environment, body language signals, and suggested conversation starters - just with different levels of structure and randomization.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**As Anxious Alex** (needs confidence building):
- I want to see detailed context about my practice partner and environment before starting so that I can mentally prepare my approach and reduce my social anxiety
- I want AI-suggested conversation starters so that I have fallback options if I freeze up during the conversation

**As Comeback Catherine** (returning to dating):
- I want to understand body language signals (green/yellow/red) so that I can gauge receptiveness before engaging and practice reading social cues
- I want realistic environmental details so that my practice feels authentic and applicable to real-world scenarios

**As Confident Carlos** (skill optimization):
- I want context that includes challenging elements (negative body language, busy environment) so that I can practice difficult situations and refine my approach
- I want the ability to generate new context for the same scenario so that I can practice different variations and edge cases

**As Shy Sarah** (needs extensive support):
- I want to take my time reviewing context without pressure so that I can process all information and build confidence before starting
- I want clear, detailed descriptions of everything I might observe so that I feel fully prepared for the interaction

### Secondary User Stories

**As any user**:
- I want to regenerate context if the current scenario doesn't appeal to me so that I can find practice situations that match my current mindset
- I want to reference context information during conversation if I need reminders about the situation

## Feature Purpose and Goals

### Primary Goals

**Confidence Building:**
- Reduce user anxiety through comprehensive preparation
- Provide multiple conversation starter options to prevent "freezing up"
- Build social cue reading skills through body language interpretation
- Create realistic practice scenarios that transfer to real-world situations

**Educational Value:**
- Teach users to observe and interpret environmental and social context
- Model effective conversation starters for different scenarios
- Demonstrate how context influences conversation approach
- Build pattern recognition for social situations

**User Engagement:**
- Maintain excitement and anticipation for the conversation
- Provide enough detail to feel immersive without overwhelming
- Allow user control through regeneration and customization options
- Smooth transition from scenario selection to active conversation

### Success Metrics

**User Engagement:**
- 85%+ of users review all four context cards before starting conversation
- Average context review time: 45-90 seconds (thorough but not stalled)
- Context regeneration usage: 15-20% of sessions (indicates engagement without dissatisfaction)

**Educational Effectiveness:**
- User-reported confidence increase: 60%+ after seeing context
- Conversation starter usage: 40%+ of users try suggested openers
- Body language signal comprehension: 70%+ accuracy in post-conversation quiz

**Conversion to Conversation:**
- Context-to-conversation completion rate: 90%+ (high conversion from preparation to practice)
- Time from context to conversation start: <2 minutes average
- Context abandonment rate: <5% (users don't leave after seeing context)

## User Flow Integration

### Entry Points

**Primary Entry Point - Scenario Selection:**
1. User selects scenario location (Coffee Shop, Bar, etc.)
2. User selects difficulty level (Green, Yellow, Red)
3. System shows loading screen: "Creating your scenario..." (2-3 seconds)
4. Pre-Conversation Context screen appears with generated content

**Secondary Entry Points:**
- "Try Different Context" from active conversation (rare but available)
- Return from "Need Help?" during conversation preparation
- Resume interrupted session from notification or app backgrounding

### Context Review Flow

**Standard Context Review Process:**
1. **Context Cards Display**: Four scrollable cards appear sequentially
   - Practice Partner card (appearance and observable details)
   - Environment card (time, crowd, atmosphere)
   - Body Language card (receptiveness signals with color coding)
   - Conversation Starters card (3 AI-generated suggestions)

2. **User Review Actions**:
   - Scroll through cards to read all information
   - Progress indicator shows review completion (4/4 cards viewed)
   - Option to regenerate entire context or return to scenario selection

3. **Transition to Conversation**:
   - "Start Conversation" button activates after all cards reviewed
   - Smooth transition to conversation interface
   - Context remains accessible during conversation via header button

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

**Context Generation Failures:**
- AI service timeout: Show fallback pre-written context for popular scenario/difficulty combinations
- Inappropriate content detected: Automatically regenerate with stricter content filters
- Network connectivity issues: Cache recent context generations for offline review

**User Abandonment Scenarios:**
- Extended review time (5+ minutes): Gentle prompt "Ready to start your conversation?"
- Multiple regenerations (4+): Suggest different scenario or difficulty level
- Back navigation: Confirm intent to leave and offer to save progress
