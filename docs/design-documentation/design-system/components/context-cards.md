## Usage Guidelines

### Content Generation Principles

**Consistency:**
- All four cards must be coherent and non-contradictory
- Details should logically support the scenario and difficulty
- Environmental factors should influence body language signals

**Appropriateness:**
- Content must be respectful and inclusive
- Age-appropriate for the target age range (18+)
- Culturally sensitive and broadly relatable

**Educational Value:**
- Signals should teach actual body language reading
- Environment details should feel realistic and specific
- Conversation starters should model good conversation techniques

### Performance Considerations

**Content Loading:**
- **Generation Time**: Target <3 seconds for complete context
- **Caching**: Cache successful generations for re-use
- **Fallbacks**: Pre-written content for generation failures
- **Progressive Loading**: Show cards as they're generated

**Memory Management:**
- **Context Storage**: Store current context in memory during conversation
- **History**: Limited history of recent contexts for back navigation
- **Cleanup**: Clear old context when new scenarios selected

## Implementation Notes

### AI Integration Points

**Context Generation API:**
- Input: scenario, difficulty, user preferences
- Output: structured context data for all four cards  
- Validation: Coherence and appropriateness checking
- Fallbacks: Default content templates for failures

**Content Structure:**
```json
{
  "partner": {
    "ageRange": "Mid-20s",
    "style": "Casual-professional...",
    "details": ["Reading a paperback novel...", "..."]
  },
  "environment": {
    "timeContext": "Tuesday afternoon...",
    "crowdLevel": "Moderately busy...",
    "details": ["Soft indie music...", "..."]
  },
  "bodyLanguage": {
    "signals": [
      { "type": "positive", "description": "Making brief eye contact..." },
      { "type": "neutral", "description": "Occasionally checks phone..." }
    ]
  },
  "starters": [
    "That book looks interesting...",
    "This place has such great atmosphere...",
    "I couldn't help but notice..."
  ]
}
```

### Platform Adaptations

**iOS:**
- **Native Scrolling**: Use native scroll physics and indicators
