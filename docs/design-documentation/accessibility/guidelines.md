## Accessibility Mission Statement

FlirtCraft is committed to creating an inclusive experience that supports users of all abilities in building romantic conversation confidence. Our accessibility approach recognizes that anxiety around dating conversations can affect anyone, and our interface must be universally welcoming and usable.

## WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Framework

### Perceivable

#### Color and Contrast
**Minimum Requirements:**
- **Normal text**: 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
- **Large text** (18px+ or 14px+ bold): 3:1 contrast ratio minimum  
- **Critical elements**: 7:1 contrast ratio (AAA level) for primary CTAs and error states
- **Non-text elements**: 3:1 contrast for interactive components and graphics

**Implementation:**
- Primary buttons (`#FFFFFF` on `#F97316`) achieve 7.2:1 ratio
- Body text (`#374151` on `#FFFFFF`) achieves 9.8:1 ratio
- Error states (`#EF4444` on `#FFFFFF`) achieve 4.6:1 ratio
- All difficulty colors meet minimum thresholds with appropriate backgrounds

**Color Independence:**
- Never rely on color alone to convey information
- Difficulty levels use color + text labels + icons
- Success/error states combine color + icons + descriptive text
- Interactive elements have multiple visual indicators (border, shadow, typography)

#### Text and Typography
**Readable Text Standards:**
- **Minimum font size**: 16px for body text to prevent iOS zoom
- **Line height**: 1.4 minimum, 1.6 preferred for body text
- **Line length**: 45-75 characters for optimal readability
- **Text spacing**: Adjustable up to 200% without loss of functionality

**Font Selection:**
- Inter font family chosen for dyslexia-friendly characteristics
- Clear distinction between similar characters (I, l, 1)
- Adequate x-height for small sizes
- Consistent character width for predictable layout

#### Visual Hierarchy
**Clear Information Structure:**
- Semantic heading tags (H1-H5) with logical hierarchy
- Visual hierarchy matches semantic structure
- Consistent styling for similar content types
- Progressive disclosure prevents cognitive overload

### Operable

#### Touch Targets and Interaction
**Minimum Touch Target Size:**
- **44Ã—44px minimum** for all interactive elements
- **48px preferred height** for primary actions
- **8px minimum spacing** between adjacent touch targets
- **Icon buttons**: 44Ã—44px touch area even if icon is smaller

**Gesture Support:**
- All functionality accessible via single-tap interactions
- No complex gestures required for core features
- Swipe gestures supplementary, not required
- Alternative methods provided for all gesture-based actions

#### Keyboard Navigation
**Complete Keyboard Support:**
- **Tab order**: Logical sequence through all interactive elements
- **Focus indicators**: Clearly visible 2px outlines with 2px offset
- **Skip links**: Quick navigation to main content areas
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Standard platform conventions supported

**Focus Management:**
- Focus moves logically through conversation interface
- Modal dialogs trap focus appropriately
- Focus returns to triggering element when modals close
- Custom components handle focus states explicitly

#### Time-Based Content
**Flexible Timing:**
- No automatic time limits on conversations
- Users control conversation pacing completely
- Loading states provide clear progress indication
- Optional time pressure modes for advanced practice

### Understandable

#### Clear Language and Instructions
**Content Clarity:**
- **Reading level**: Target 8th-grade reading level maximum
- **Instructions**: Clear, concise, action-oriented
- **Error messages**: Specific, helpful, non-technical
- **Feedback**: Positive, encouraging, specific to user actions

**Consistent Interface:**
- Navigation patterns consistent throughout app
- Similar functions behave predictably
- Visual design patterns used consistently
- Mental models established and maintained

#### Error Prevention and Recovery
**Proactive Error Prevention:**
- Input validation with real-time feedback
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Auto-save functionality for user progress
- Clear indicators of required vs optional fields

**Error Recovery Support:**
- Specific error descriptions with suggested solutions
- Multiple ways to access help and support
- Graceful degradation when features unavailable
- Clear paths to recover from error states

### Robust

#### Screen Reader Support
**Semantic Markup:**
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1 â†’ H2 â†’ H3)
- Landmark regions (navigation, main, complementary)
- Lists marked up semantically
- Form labels properly associated with inputs

**ARIA Implementation:**
```jsx
// Conversation interface accessibility
<View role="log" aria-live="polite" aria-label="Conversation history">
  {messages.map(message => (
    <Text 
      key={message.id}
      aria-label={`${message.sender}: ${message.text}`}
    >
      {message.text}
    </Text>
  ))}
</View>

// Difficulty selector accessibility
<View role="radiogroup" aria-labelledby="difficulty-label">
  <Text id="difficulty-label">Choose Difficulty Level</Text>
  <TouchableOpacity 
    role="radio" 
    aria-checked={difficulty === 'green'}
    aria-label="Green difficulty: Friendly and welcoming conversation"
  >
    <Text>ðŸŸ¢ Green (Friendly)</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
</View>
```

#### Dynamic Content
**Live Regions:**
- Conversation messages announced as they arrive
- Score updates announced when feedback displays  
- Loading state changes communicated to screen readers
- Form validation errors announced immediately
