## Overview

FlirtCraft is designed to be inclusive and accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or assistive technology needs. Our accessibility strategy ensures that every user can build conversation confidence through our AI-powered practice platform.

## Accessibility Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Universal Design:**
- Design for the widest range of users from the beginning
- One solution that works for everyone, rather than separate accessible versions
- Consider accessibility in every design decision

**User-Centered Approach:**
- Real user testing with assistive technology users
- Iterative improvement based on accessibility feedback
- Documentation that serves both users and developers

**Legal and Ethical Compliance:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as minimum standard
- Platform-specific accessibility guideline adherence
- Proactive accessibility rather than reactive compliance

### Success Metrics

**Measurable Accessibility Goals:**
- 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all features
- Screen reader task completion rate >90%
- Keyboard navigation success rate >95%
- User satisfaction ratings >4.0/5.0 from assistive technology users
