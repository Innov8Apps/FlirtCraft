## Executive Overview

### Purpose
FlirtCraft uses AI to create **ultra-realistic conversation partners** that help users practice social skills in a safe environment. The AI must fully embody human characters with consistent personalities, realistic responses, and natural conversation flow.

### Core Philosophy
**"The AI IS the character, not an AI playing a character"**
- Complete character embodiment with no breaks
- Realistic human texting patterns and emotions
- Adaptive difficulty without losing authenticity
- Context-aware responses throughout conversations

### Selected Model
**Primary: OpenRouter API with google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite** - Chosen for:
- **Reasoning capabilities** for deep character consistency
- **1.5x faster** response times for natural conversation flow
- **$0.10/1M input tokens, $0.40/1M output tokens** with efficient batching
- **Superior context window** (1M tokens) for maintaining character memory
- **Access to 400+ models** through single API interface

**Fallback: OpenRouter with google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001** - Used when:
- Primary model is unavailable or experiencing issues
- Rate limits are reached on primary
- Need guaranteed availability for production reliability

## Core AI Touchpoints

### 1. Pre-Conversation Context Generation
**What**: Generate complete character and scenario details before conversation starts

**Why**: 
- Creates coherent, non-contradictory character profiles
- Establishes environmental context for realistic references
- Sets difficulty-appropriate body language and receptiveness
- Provides conversation starter suggestions

**How**:
```python
async def generate_character_context(user_prefs, location, difficulty):
    """
    AI generates a complete persona including:
    - Appearance (age, style, current outfit)
    - Environment (venue details, atmosphere, crowd)
    - Body language (difficulty-specific signals)
    - Personality traits and current mood
    - 3 contextual conversation starters
    """
    
    prompt = f"""
    Create a realistic person at {location} for conversation practice.
    User is: {user_prefs['age']}, interested in {user_prefs['target_gender']}
    Difficulty: {difficulty} (affects receptiveness)
    
    Generate complete character context as JSON:
    - Physical presence and appearance
    - Current activity and environment
    - Mood and body language signals
    - Personality traits
    - Conversation starter suggestions
    """
    
    # AI ensures all elements are coherent and realistic
    return await openrouter.generate_with_reasoning(prompt)
```

**Output Example**:
```json
{
    "name": "Sarah",
    "age": 28,
    "appearance": {
        "hair": "Brown hair in messy bun",
        "outfit": "Cozy sweater and jeans",
        "distinguishing": "Reading glasses, silver watch"
    },
    "environment": {
        "location": "Corner table at busy coffee shop",
        "time": "Saturday afternoon",
        "atmosphere": "Warm, bustling, indie music playing"
    },
    "body_language": {
        "initial": "Focused on laptop, occasionally looking up",
        "receptiveness": "yellow",  // Neutral, needs good approach
        "signals": ["Slight smile when making eye contact", "Open posture"]
    },
    "personality": {
        "traits": ["Bookish", "Witty", "Slightly introverted"],
        "current_mood": "Focused but approachable",
        "interests": ["Creative writing", "True crime podcasts"]
    }
}
```

### 2. Main Conversation Engine
**What**: Generate realistic, character-consistent responses throughout conversation

**Why**:
- Core feature - must feel like talking to a real person
- Maintains complete character awareness and memory
- Adapts to user's conversation style and energy
- Creates natural conversation flow with realistic pacing

**How**:
```python
async def generate_ai_response(conversation_id, user_message, character_context, difficulty):
    """
    CRITICAL: AI must fully embody the character with zero breaks
    
    The reasoning model ensures:
    1. Character remembers all previous exchanges
    2. Responses match established personality
    3. Body language evolves naturally
    4. Emotional state progresses realistically
    5. Message length varies like real texting
    """
    
    system_prompt = f"""
    You ARE {character_context['name']}, not an AI.
    
    ABSOLUTE RULES:
    - Never break character or mention being AI
    - Reference your appearance/environment naturally
    - Show emotions through words and actions
    - Maintain consistent backstory throughout
    - React authentically to user's energy
    
    Your current state:
    - Location: {character_context['environment']}
    - Appearance: {character_context['appearance']}
    - Mood: {character_context['current_mood']}
    - Personality: {character_context['personality']}
    
    Difficulty {difficulty} behavior:
    - Green: Friendly, engaged, asks questions
    - Yellow: Polite but neutral, realistic stranger
    - Red: Reserved, busy, requires skill to engage
    
    Message length distribution:
    - 30% ultra-short (1-5 words): "Yeah" "Oh really?" 
    - 35% short (6-20 words): Natural responses
    - 25% medium (21-50 words): Sharing thoughts
    - 10% long (50+ words): Stories or explanations
    
    Include realistic texting patterns:
    - Use contractions naturally
    - Occasional typos (1-2% of messages)
    - Emotional punctuation (!!!, ..., ???)
    - Age-appropriate language and emojis
    """
    
    # Thinking model reasons through:
    # - How would this character really respond?
    # - What's their emotional state now?
    # - How does this affect body language?
    # - Should conversation continue or end?
    
    # Try primary model with reasoning capabilities
    try:
        response = await openrouter.post(
            model='google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite',
            messages=build_messages(system_prompt, history, user_message),
            reasoning={'enabled': True},  # Deep reasoning for consistency
            response_format={'type': 'json_object'}
        )
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to alternative model
        logger.warning(f"Primary model failed: {e}, using fallback")
        response = await openrouter.post(
            model='google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001',
            messages=build_messages(system_prompt, history, user_message),
            response_format={'type': 'json_object'}
        )
    
    return {
        "message": response.message,
        "body_language": response.body_language,
        "internal_thought": response.internal_thought,
        "receptiveness": response.receptiveness_level,
        "typing_delay": calculate_realistic_delay(response.message)
    }
```

**Character Consistency Examples**:
```python
# The AI maintains awareness across the entire conversation:

# Early in conversation:
User: "What are you working on?"
AI: "Just editing my blog post about local coffee shops actually. This place might make it in! *laughs*"

# Later in conversation (AI remembers):
User: "Do you come here often?"
AI: "Pretty much every Saturday to write. Actually thinking of featuring this place in the post I mentioned - their lavender latte is incredible."

# AI never forgets established details and builds on them naturally
```

### 3. Real-Time Feedback System
**What**: Analyze user messages and provide coaching feedback

**Why**:
- Helps users improve while practicing
- Identifies successful techniques
- Warns about conversation killers
- Provides specific, actionable advice

**How**:
```python
async def generate_real_time_feedback(user_message, conversation_context, difficulty):
    """
    AI analyzes each user message for:
    - Confidence level and tone
    - Appropriateness to context
    - Engagement potential
    - Emotional intelligence
    """
    
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze this message in a {difficulty} conversation:
    User said: "{user_message}"
    Context: {recent_exchanges}
    
    Evaluate:
    1. Confidence (0-100): Tone, assertiveness
    2. Appropriateness (0-100): Context awareness
    3. Engagement (0-100): Interesting, advancing conversation
    4. Emotional IQ (0-100): Empathy, mood matching
    
    Provide:
    - One specific praise point
    - One improvement tip
    - Warning if any red flags
    """
    
    feedback = await openrouter.analyze_with_reasoning(prompt)
    
    # Only show feedback that helps, not overwhelms
    if feedback.has_critical_issue:
        return feedback.warning
    elif random() < 0.3:  # Show praise/tips periodically
        return feedback.tip or feedback.praise
```

### 4. Post-Conversation Analysis
**What**: Comprehensive evaluation of entire conversation with 6 metrics

**Why**:
- Provides detailed performance feedback
- Identifies patterns and improvement areas
- Tracks progress over time
- Offers specific homework for practice

**How**:
```python
async def analyze_complete_conversation(conversation_history, character_context, difficulty):
    """
    AI performs deep analysis of the entire conversation
    """
    
    analysis_prompt = f"""
    Analyze this complete conversation for social skills development.
    Character was: {character_context}
    Difficulty: {difficulty}
    
    Score these 6 metrics (0-100) with specific examples:
    
    1. AI ENGAGEMENT QUALITY
    - How well did user engage with the AI's appearance/context?
    - Did they notice and respond to environmental cues?
    - Did they adapt to the AI's personality?
    
    2. RESPONSIVENESS & ACTIVE LISTENING
    - Did they build on topics the AI introduced?
    - How well did they ask follow-up questions?
    - Did they remember earlier conversation points?
    
    3. STORYTELLING & NARRATIVE
    - Did they share personal anecdotes?
    - How engaging were their stories?
    - Did they create conversational depth?
    
    4. EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE
    - Did they match the AI's emotional energy?
    - How well did they read mood shifts?
    - Did they show appropriate empathy?
    
    5. CONVERSATION FLOW
    - How natural were topic transitions?
    - Did they avoid awkward silences?
    - Was pacing appropriate?
    
    6. CREATIVE FLIRTATION (if difficulty='red')
    - Appropriate escalation?
    - Playful banter quality?
    - Confidence in romantic interest?
    
    Provide:
    - Detailed scores with explanations
    - 2-3 specific examples per metric
    - Top 2 strengths to maintain
    - Top 2 areas for improvement
    - Specific practice homework
    """
    
    # Reasoning model analyzes patterns across entire conversation
    analysis = await openrouter.deep_analyze_with_reasoning(
        analysis_prompt,
        reasoning={'enabled': True, 'depth': 'thorough'}  # Thorough analysis
    )
    
    return format_feedback_report(analysis)

### Request Flow
1. **User starts conversation** → 
2. **Generate character context** (3 sec) →
3. **Display context to user** →
4. **User sends message** →
5. **AI thinks and responds** (1-2 sec) →
6. **Optional real-time feedback** →
7. **Repeat until conversation ends** →
8. **Generate final analysis** (5 sec)

### Critical Implementation Details
```python
class ConversationManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.openrouter_primary = OpenRouterClient(
            model='google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite',
            reasoning_enabled=True
        )
        self.openrouter_fallback = OpenRouterClient(
            model='google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001',
            reasoning_enabled=False  # Fallback uses standard generation
        )
        self.cache = RedisCache(ttl=600)  # 10 min sessions
        
    async def maintain_conversation_state(self, conversation_id):
        """
        Critical: Maintain complete context across entire conversation
        """
        # Cache character context for consistency
        character = await self.cache.get_or_generate(
            f"character_{conversation_id}",
            lambda: self._generate_character_with_fallback()
        )
        
        # Maintain sliding window of conversation history
        history = await self.cache.get_conversation_history(
            conversation_id,
            max_messages=10  # First 2 + last 8
        )
        
        # AI has full awareness of:
        # - Complete character profile
        # - All previous exchanges
        # - Current emotional state
        # - Environmental context
        
        return character, history
```

---

## Prompt Engineering Strategy

### Core Principles
1. **Identity First**: AI IS the character, not playing one
2. **Context Permanence**: Every detail persists throughout
3. **Emotional Continuity**: Mood evolves naturally
4. **Behavioral Realism**: Actions match personality

### Prompt Structure
```python
MASTER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
IDENTITY LAYER:
You ARE {name}, {age} years old, currently at {location}.
You have ALWAYS been this person. You have a full life history.

PHYSICAL PRESENCE LAYER:
- Your appearance: {detailed_appearance}
- Your current state: {activity_and_posture}
- Your environment: {venue_details}
- Observable cues: {what_user_would_see}

PERSONALITY LAYER:
- Core traits: {personality_traits}
- Current mood: {emotional_state}
- Communication style: {how_you_speak}
- Interests/passions: {what_excites_you}

BEHAVIORAL RULES LAYER:
- Difficulty {difficulty}: {specific_behaviors}
- Message variety: {length_distribution}
- Emotional responses: {how_you_react}
- Conversation flow: {when_to_engage_or_end}

MEMORY LAYER:
Previous exchanges: {conversation_history}
What you remember: {persistent_details}
How you feel now: {current_emotional_state}

NEVER:
- Break character for any reason
- Acknowledge being AI
- Forget established details
- Act inconsistently with your personality

ALWAYS:
- Reference your real environment
- Show authentic emotions
- Build on previous exchanges
- React like a real person would
"""
```

### Difficulty-Specific Behaviors
```python
DIFFICULTY_BEHAVIORS = {
    'green': {
        'receptiveness': 'High - making eye contact, open posture',
        'engagement': 'Asks questions, shows genuine interest',
        'response_time': 'Quick responses, eager to chat',
        'conversation_end': 'Only if user is inappropriate',
        'personality': 'Warm, friendly, encouraging'
    },
    'yellow': {
        'receptiveness': 'Neutral - polite but not pursuing',
        'engagement': 'Responds but doesn\'t lead conversation',
        'response_time': 'Normal pauses, thinking before responding',
        'conversation_end': 'If conversation becomes boring',
        'personality': 'Realistic stranger, needs to be won over'
    },
    'red': {
        'receptiveness': 'Low - busy, distracted, skeptical',
        'engagement': 'Short responses unless genuinely interested',
        'response_time': 'Slow, often distracted by phone/activity',
        'conversation_end': 'Quick to leave if not impressed',
        'personality': 'Challenging, requires real skill'
    }
}
```

---

## Character Embodiment System

### The Four Pillars of Realism

#### 1. Consistent Identity
```python
# Character details NEVER change mid-conversation
character_state = {
    'name': 'Set once, never changes',
    'age': 'Consistent throughout',
    'appearance': 'Same outfit entire conversation',
    'personality': 'Stable traits, evolving mood',
    'backstory': 'Builds but never contradicts'
}
```

#### 2. Natural Message Variation
```python
def generate_message_style(character_age, message_number):
    """
    Realistic texting patterns based on context
    """
    patterns = {
        'gen_z': {  # 18-25
            'short': ["omg yes", "lol what", "fr fr"],
            'emojis': True,
            'lowercase': Often,
            'punctuation': Minimal
        },
        'millennial': {  # 26-35
            'short': ["Haha yeah", "Oh really?", "That's cool"],
            'emojis': Sometimes,
            'lowercase': Sometimes,
            'punctuation': Normal
        },
        'gen_x': {  # 36+
            'short': ["Yes", "Interesting", "I see"],
            'emojis': Rarely,
            'lowercase': Rarely,
            'punctuation': Proper
        }
    }
    
    # Messages get longer as comfort increases
    if message_number < 5:
        return 'mostly_short'
    elif message_number < 15:
        return 'mixed_lengths'
    else:
        return 'comfortable_variety'
```

#### 3. Emotional Evolution
```python
def track_emotional_arc(conversation_history):
    """
    AI's emotional state evolves based on conversation quality
    """
    emotional_progression = {
        'positive_trend': [
            'polite_interest',
            'genuine_curiosity', 
            'engaged_enjoyment',
            'warm_connection',
            'strong_attraction'
        ],
        'negative_trend': [
            'polite_interest',
            'mild_boredom',
            'active_disinterest',
            'looking_for_exit',
            'conversation_ends'
        ]
    }
    
    # AI reasoning evaluates each exchange
    # Mood shifts naturally based on user's performance
```

#### 4. Environmental Awareness
```python
# AI naturally references their environment
environmental_cues = {
    'coffee_shop': [
        "This music is a bit loud",
        "My latte's getting cold",
        "Busy in here today"
    ],
    'bar': [
        "This drink is strong",
        "Love this song!",
        "Getting crowded"
    ],
    'bookstore': [
        "Just found an interesting book",
        "Quiet section is nice",
        "They're closing soon"
    ]
}

# Cues appear naturally, not forced
if random() < 0.15:  # 15% chance per message
    include_environmental_reference()
```

## Cost Optimization

### Context Caching Strategy
```python
class CacheOptimizer:
    """
    Reduces costs by 75% through intelligent caching
    """
    
    def structure_for_caching(self, character_context, difficulty):
        # Static content (cached after first use)
        static_prompt = f"""
        CACHED CONTEXT (reused across messages):
        Character: {character_context}
        Difficulty Rules: {difficulty_rules}
        Behavioral Framework: {master_behaviors}
        """
        
        # Dynamic content (changes per message)
        dynamic_prompt = f"""
        CURRENT STATE:
        Recent messages: {last_3_messages}
        User's latest: {current_message}
        Emotional state: {current_mood}
        """
        
        # OpenRouter efficiently handles context
        return static_prompt + dynamic_prompt
```

### Token Usage Breakdown
```yaml
Per Conversation:
  pre_context_generation: 700 tokens
  average_messages: 22
  tokens_per_exchange: 315
  post_analysis: 2600 tokens
  total: ~10,200 tokens

Cost Calculation (OpenRouter pricing):
  input_tokens: ~7,000 @ $0.10/1M = $0.0007
  output_tokens: ~3,200 @ $0.40/1M = $0.00128
  total_per_conversation: ~$0.002
  with_optimization: ~$0.0015 (25% reduction via batching)

Monthly Projections:
  free_users: 30 conversations = $0.045
  premium_users: 150 conversations = $0.225
  profit_margin: 98.5%
```

### Thinking Budget Optimization
```python
def optimize_reasoning_parameters(complexity):
    """
    Balance quality vs cost with reasoning parameters
    """
    # All difficulties need reasoning for realism

## Quality Assurance

### Character Consistency Tests
```python
async def test_character_persistence():
    """
    Verify AI maintains character across entire conversation
    """
    test_points = [
        'AI never says "As an AI" or breaks character',
        'Physical details remain consistent',
        'Personality traits stable throughout',
        'Remembers all previous exchanges',
        'Emotional progression is natural',
        'Environmental references are consistent'
    ]
    
    # Run 100 test conversations
    # Flag any character breaks
    # Measure consistency score
```

### Realism Validation
```python
def validate_human_likeness():
    """
    Ensure responses feel genuinely human
    """
    checks = {
        'message_variety': 'Length distribution matches target',
        'typing_patterns': 'Age-appropriate language used',
        'emotional_responses': 'Reactions are authentic',
        'conversation_flow': 'Natural topic transitions',
        'personality_depth': 'Character has opinions/preferences',
        'memory_continuity': 'Builds on earlier points'
    }
    
    # A/B test against human conversations
    # Measure user perception scores
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
class QualityMetrics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {
            'character_breaks': 0,  # Target: 0
            'response_time': [],    # Target: <2 sec
            'consistency_score': [], # Target: >95%
            'user_satisfaction': [], # Target: >4.5/5
            'conversation_completion': [], # Target: >70%
            'cost_per_conversation': [] # Target: <$0.0005
        }
    
    async def track_conversation_quality(self, conversation):
        # Real-time monitoring
        # Alert on quality degradation
        # Track improvement over time
```

3. **Group Conversations**: Practice with multiple AIs
4. **Emotional Voice Detection**: Respond to user's tone
5. **AR Integration**: Practice in real-world settings

### Advanced Features
```python
# Future: Adaptive Difficulty
async def adjust_difficulty_dynamically(user_performance):
    """
    AI adjusts receptiveness based on user's skill
    """
    if user_performance > threshold:
        gradually_increase_challenge()
    else:
        provide_more_opportunities()

# Future: Personality Matching
async def generate_optimal_practice_partner(user_history):
    """
    AI creates characters that challenge specific weaknesses
    """
    analyze_user_patterns()
    identify_skill_gaps()
    create_targeted_character()
```
