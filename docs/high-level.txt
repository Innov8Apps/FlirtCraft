4. Conversation Interface
Core Mechanics:

Real-time chat with AI agent
AI takes the gender that the user preselected in his preferences (male/female/randomized)
AI perceives and remembers user's age from profile (for appropriate interactions)
AI maintains full context awareness:

Generated appearance details from context screen
Environmental factors
Body language starting position
Previous messages in conversation
User's stated age and preferences


12-minute maximum conversation length or 50 message in total (25 from ai and 25 from user)
Natural conversation endings (success or polite exit)

Live Feedback System:
Apperas situationally and not overwhelmingly and suttle.

ðŸŸ¢ Positive: "She's leaning in", "Genuine laugh"
ðŸŸ¡ Neutral: "Listening politely", "Checking phone briefly"
ðŸ”´ Warning: "Looking for exits", "Short responses"
ðŸ’¡ Tips: "Try asking about interests", "Good timing for compliment"

AI Behavior Rules:
